## Change Log

**2023/12/11:** We previously indicated that Google Search Console collects data from search engines using Google's system (such as Yahoo! Japan), but we have corrected this as it was found to be inaccurate. We deeply apologize for the misinformation that was published over an extended period.

**2023/01/23:** Notation correction.

**2022/09/21:** Switched from using the access analysis tool GoatCounter to Cloudflare Web Analytics, and improved readability and user experience.

## Privacy Policy

This privacy policy outlines what information our site collects from users and how it is utilized. The policy applies to all services provided under the frogapp.net domain, including subdomains.

## Information Collected

Our site uses two services, [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/) and [Cloudflare Web Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/), to collect user access data. The main data collected includes:

### Google Search Console

* Display count of our site in Google searches
* Number of visitors from Google searches to our site
* Average ranking of our site in Google searches
* Browser and OS used when our site is searched on Google
* Country of origin of access when our site is searched on Google
* Search queries used on Google to reach our site

### Cloudflare Web Analytics

* Access date and time
* Country of access
* Browser and OS used for access
* Referring site (e.g., Google search, Twitter, etc.)
* Time taken to load pages

The access analysis services do not collect information that can personally identify individuals. Additionally, operators can only view information processed through statistical analysis by the access analysis service.

The collected information is used to analyze trends in visitor interests, provide better content, and promptly identify and rectify issues with web pages.

## Information Not Collected

Our site does not collect and has no intention of collecting users' personal information (information that can identify individuals). The operator cannot access information such as timer settings, alarm sounds, or numbers generated in Yamada BINGO.

App save data is stored on users' devices, not on servers.

(Specifically, it uses the "Local Storage" mechanism.)

Users can delete this data from their browser settings, and in incognito mode, the data is automatically deleted when the browser is closed.

## About Cookies

Our site's programs often include services and programs created by third parties. While these programs may use cookies, it is for the purpose of providing users with a comfortable experience and not for tracking users.

## Other

If there are any unclear or confusing points or if you have any requests, please feel free to write to us via the [contact form](/en/contact) or [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/r-40021/new-portfolio-and-blog/issues).

\*This privacy policy may be changed without notice.
