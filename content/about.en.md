description: The overview of the site and an introduction of the owner.
---

This is an overview of the site and an introduction of the owner.

Since the content is occasionally updated, it would be great if you could access it whenever you remember.

## About This Site

This is a personal blog where the owner writes about their favorite things, from digital content to spot-the-difference games.

### Posting Frequency

From late May 2022, I had been updating at approximately a weekly pace, but recently I've realized that quality is more important than quantity, ~~(and also because I've been getting tired of writing articles every week,)~~ I'm returning to irregular updates as before.

### Policy

* All sponsored posts will be declined
* Write honestly about what I think

That's the gist of it.

Please note that this is a personal blog where the owner writes freely, so there is no accurate, objective information that could be used for academic research, for example.

(Well, I don't expect people who are looking for that kind of information to come to this site...)

### Technical Details

This site is made using the Hugo framework.

Previously, Jekyll was used, but it was migrated due to integration with the portfolio site.

Cloudflare Pages is used for hosting, and it is operated completely free of charge except for the domain fee.

That's why there are no ads and it doesn't run at a loss.

### Access Analysis

We use "Cloudflare Web Analytics", a privacy-friendly tool, to analyze the number of accesses.

This is to help with future article writing by knowing which articles are popular.

For details, please see the [Privacy Policy](/en/privacy).
